# cipher-things
This repo holds a simple and possibly rubbish implementation of Vigenere cipher decryption, Kasiski Test, coincidence index calculation.
Sample outputs are in .txt files.
Yes, it does not read the input from any file and terminal and it sucks. You have to hardcode it into the main.cpp.

Also, there exists simple lsfr implementation written in python. Wanna check what it does?
